# The Big Squeeze: The Effect of Inflation on Housing, Employment and Spending power

## **Project Overview**

### *Package Requirements and Versions*

`pip install x` ; where 'x' is the package listed below:
* `python == 3.7.13+` 
* `pandas == 2.2.2`
* `hvplot == 0.7.3`
* `matplotlib == 3.5.1`

### *Files Navigation*
* Resources: Directory containing all images of plots created in Jupyter Notebook, and original csv data files
* Data: Directory containing all of the data sources used by the code
* `data_analysis.ipynb`: Data research using csv files, modules and API connections, and final dataframes and all graphs
  
  
### *Purpose of Use*   
Our team decided to research the effects of inflation during during a Pre- and Post-Pandemic date range, investigating true inflation percentage, annual inflation against a 2% average, consumer price index (CPI) reflects house related costs, unemployment rate,[5],[6],[7] and [8].

The business question we hope to answer is: *?*

Our motivation for taking on this challenge is to find out if there is clear causation, or merely a correlation, between the effect of inflation on housing, unemployment and spending power.

We hope to find this data using the cost of housing prices from Data.gov, and the effect CPI and unemployment rates from the U.S. Department of Labor.

The periods of inflation analyzed include:
* Data Dates: 
  * Pre-Pandemic: 2015-2019
  * Post-Pandemic: 2020-2023


## Data Pre-Processing/Gathering Steps
Our team accessed inflation data from kaggle, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Labor.
