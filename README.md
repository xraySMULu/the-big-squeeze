# The Big Squeeze: The Effect of Inflation on Housing, Employment and Spending power

## **Project Overview**

### *Package Requirements and Versions*

`pip install x` ; where 'x' is the package listed below:
* `python == 3.7.13+` 
* `pandas == 2.2.2`
* `hvplot == 0.7.3`
* `matplotlib == 3.5.1`

### *Files Navigation*
* Resources: Directory containing all images of plots created in Jupyter Notebook, and original csv data files
* Data: Directory containing all of the data sources used by the code
* `data_analysis.ipynb`: Data research using csv files, modules and API connections, and final dataframes and all graphs
  
  
### *Purpose of Use*   
Our team decided to research the effects of inflation during during a Pre- and Post-Pandemic date range, investigating true inflation percentage, annual inflation against a 2% average, consumer price index (CPI) reflects house related costs, unemployment rate,Correlation between the consumer price Index (CPI) and the Home price Index(HPI),Impact of Housing cost on Foreclosures and Mortgage rates,[7] and [8].

The business question we hope to answer is: *?*

Our motivation for taking on this challenge is to find out if there is clear causation, or merely a correlation, between the effect of inflation on housing, unemployment and spending power.

We hope to find this data using the cost of housing prices from Data.gov, and the effect CPI and unemployment rates from the U.S. Department of Labor.

The periods of inflation analyzed include:
* Data Dates: 
  * Pre-Pandemic: 2015-2019
  * Post-Pandemic: 2020-2023


## Data Pre-Processing/Gathering Steps
Our team accessed inflation data from kaggle, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Labor.

* Obtained time-series data in the CSV format from Federal Reserve Economic Data and Kaggle 
* Cleaned the dataset by renaming and filtering the columns.
* Sliced the dataframe to align the timelines
* Handled the missing data
* Normalized the data for comparison.

To obtain the Housing Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Unemployment Rate data:

Source: The data is typically sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides monthly and annual statistics through its public API and downloadable datasets.

Time Frames:
Pre-Pandemic data covers the period 2015-2019.
Post-Pandemic data covers the period 2020-2024.

Series Identifiers:
Housing CPI: Series that reflects the cost of housing-related expenses.
Unemployment Rate: Series that tracks the percentage of unemployed individuals in the labor force.

Access Methods:
Data can be fetched using the BLS API by specifying series IDs and time ranges.
Data can also be downloaded manually in CSV or Excel formats from the BLS website.
Analysis: The data is processed and visualized to compare trends before and after the pandemic, highlighting inflation in housing and changes in unemployment rates.
