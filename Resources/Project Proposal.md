# Project Name - The Big Squeeze: The Effect of Inflation on Housing & Employment

## Overview
The goal of our project is to uncover patterns on how inflation affects Housing and Employment. Weâ€™ll examine x, y and z, and other related relationships derived from the data.


## Research Question:

"What are the key interrelationships between inflation, housing market dynamics, unemployment, and how have these relationships evolved over time?"

### Sub-questions explored
#### Inflation Trends and Deviations
* Examine how inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), aligns or deviates from the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
 #### HPI (Housing Price Index) Vs CPI (Consumer Price Index):
* What is the correlation between the Home Price Index (HPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the last two decades?
#### HPI Vs Mortgage rates:
* How does the change in mortgage rates influence the growth rate of the Home Price Index (HPI) over time?"
#### HPI VS Foreclosures:
* "How does the Home Price Index (HPI) affect foreclosure rates during periods of housing market growth and decline?"
#### CPI : Rent and OER (Owners equivalent Rent)
* How have trends in Rent CPI and Owners' Equivalent Rent (OER) CPI evolved over time?
#### Unemployment
* How has the overall unemployment rate and sectoral unemployment evolved pre- and post-pandemic?
